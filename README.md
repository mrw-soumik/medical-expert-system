# Medical Diagnostic Expert System

This is a Prolog-based expert system designed to simulate the diagnostic process of a medical professional by identifying possible diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.

## Technologies
- Prolog

## Objective
The goal of this project is to showcase a rule-based system that evaluates user inputs (symptoms) and provides probable diagnoses for common diseases.

## Key Features
- Designed a rule-based expert system in Prolog.
- Created a knowledge base from commonly known diseases and symptoms.
- Developed an interactive command-line interface for user input and diagnostic output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SWI-Prolog installed on your machine (download it from [SWI-Prolog's website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-expert-system.git
   cd medical-expert-system
2. Run the expert system:
   ```bash
   swipl -s main.pl -g start -t halt
